      <p id="tribute-paragraph">"The year is 1999 and I followed my dream to finally create a cool game. Without any money and with no Unity/Godot/Unreal Engine available for free I used the only tool that I could get my hands on: Visual Basic, Paint
        and Fast-Tracker. I
        started with a little ship that fired on astroids and showed my masterpiece around. I started to create a first level with my own level-editor and asked everybody for help and to join me. Till the end coding was my responsibility, but every
        time when my motivation left me, some new music or some new graphic lay around in my inbox. One time I was especially surprised when Malte Kollmann send me a complete new level (- it's the last level before the final boss)! He learned my
        level-editor by himself. In the end, two years later, everything came together to a great game and in my mind - beside the bad graphics - DOVE still stands the test of time." <br> -Markus Madeja</p>
